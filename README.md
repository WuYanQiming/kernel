# Kernel Description

View Chinese description  |  [查看中文说明](README.cn.md)

These kernels can be used on `Armbian` and `OpenWrt` systems, such as [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian), [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt), [flippy-openwrt-actions](https://github.com/ophub/flippy-openwrt-actions), and [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit). They can be integrated when compiling firmware or installed in existing systems for use. For specific usage methods, please refer to [kernel usage instructions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/compile-kernel/README.md#instructions-for-using-the-kernel).

The [kernel_flippy](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_flippy), [kernel_stable](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_stable), and [kernel_dev](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_dev) are universal kernels that can be interchanged. Flippy's feature is being more user-friendly, Stable is more intimate, and Dev is smoother.

- The kernel files in [kernel_flippy](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_flippy) of Releases are the `stable version`, which are a series of kernels shared by `flippy`.
- The kernel files in [kernel_stable](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_stable) of Releases are the `stable version` with more support options enabled according to user needs.
- The kernel files in [kernel_dev](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_dev) of Releases are the `development version`, which adds third-party driver support and special modifications for some specific boxes.
- The kernel files in [kernel_rk3588](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_rk3588) of Releases are `dedicated versions` for the `rk3588` series, suitable for devices such as Rock-5B, HinLink-H88K, and Beelink-IPC-R and are not interchangeable with other series.
- The kernel files in [kernel_beta](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_beta) of Releases are `beta versions` that will be sent to testers for functional testing on specific devices. Other users should not install and use them.
- In the [dev](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/dev) section of releases, there is a `cross-compilation toolchain` download image required for compiling the kernel.
- In the [tools](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools) section of releases, there are `Android system` download images for some common TV boxes, which can be used to restore the Android system when using Armbian and OpenWrt systems.

## Compiling the Kernel

- For detailed instructions on how to compile the kernel, please refer to [compile-kernel](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/tree/main/compile-kernel). The method of using github.com's Actions to compile the kernel can be found in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows). You can customize the kernel by modifying the kernel configuration file in [kernel-config](kernel-config).

- You can adjust the kernel configuration as needed, such as adding drivers and patches. You can also compile a personalized signature kernel with special significance based on your mood, such as `5.10.95-happy-new-year`, `5.10.96-beijing-winter-olympics`, `5.10.99-valentines-day`, and so on.

```yaml
